Currently, only the main views are routed properly. I've made a Team View, Player View and Table View. The team is a randomly generated set of names. The player attributes are also randomly generated. There is also a rudimentary text-based match engine. Additionally, I am planning to integrate mongodb into the project, specifically utilizing mongoose schemas for the objects within the game.
