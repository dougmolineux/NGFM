NGFM
====

Football Management Sim written with AngularJS.

State of the project
====

Currently, only the main views are routed properly. I've made a Team View, Player View and Table View. The team is a randomly generated set of names. The player attributes are also randomly generated. There is also a rudimentary text-based match engine.

Todo
====

1. Move the Player view to load from Team View
2. Allow the continuing of the season after the first match.
3. Update League table with points of results
4. Bind players and teams to match
